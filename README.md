# World_Weather_Analysis

##Purpose
The purpose for this analysis is to test our ability to work with APIs, GeoView maps, further Pandas testing, as well as a few other new modules along the way. This was accomplished by creating a simple program which first collected data from OpenWeather using an API, and having the user punch in the max and minimum temperature they would prefer for their vacation. Once we had that information we used the OpenWeather API to generate a list of suitable destinations. We then crosslisted those destinations with information from Geoapify to exclusde areas that had no hotels, and therefore would not be suitable for vacation. Next we populated a map using GeoViews and ensured it was interactable. Finally, we took four locations within the same country, used Geoapify route data to connect the four and presented the route upon a map of the four cities as an example for what a vacation itinerary could look like using the tools created and the data available.
